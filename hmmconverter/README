Binary executable
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The binary executable called HMMConverter can be found in sub-directory bin.
This executable is all you need to employ HMMConvert to set up model and to
run analyses. 

In order to use HMMConverter for a particular model, make sure the
HMMConverter executable and all input files to HMMConverter including other
executables are in the same directory.  So, if you intend to run one of the
examples included in this package, copy the HMMConverter executable (and any
other executable files, see info below) to the respective directory.

You only need to compile the source code if you need to recompile an
executable for your operating system.

Compilation of source code
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can compile the source code in sub-directory src using gcc 4.2.1
(http://gcc.gnu.org/) on a Unix machine by going to sub-directory src and
typing "make". This should generate a stand-alone executable HMMConverter
which can also be found in sub-directory bin.

Examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The sub-directory example contains several examples of hidden Markov models
and pair hidden Markov models that explain the functionality of
HMMConverter, see the manual for more details.

Additional executables
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain features of HMMConverter require additional files to be
installed. These are not part of the HMMConverter package and need to be
installed by you in order to be able to use all features of
HMMConverter. Please install the following files on your machines and ensure
that

(1) the files have the required name
(2) the files are in the same directory as the XML-file of your model, the HMMConverter executable 
    and your other input files
